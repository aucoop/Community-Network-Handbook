# Just Get Started

I think one of the biggest mistakes I tend to repeat (although I'm improving) is to spend too much time planning and thinking about how to do things, instead of just getting started and learning by doing.

When starting a community network, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the amount of things that need to be done: planning the network architecture, choosing the right hardware, setting up the software, organizing the community, etc. That's why this book follows a different approach: we focus on the practical steps to get a basic network up and running as quickly as possible. The idea is to start small, with a simple setup, and then iterate and improve over time.

Again, we are not saying this is the best way to do things, just one that worked for us. The important thing is to get started, learn from the experience, and adapt as needed. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, as they are an essential and mandatory part of the learning process.

## Structure

This book is structured in essentially two big parts: the network and the services. The network part covers everything related to the physical and logical setup of the network, including hardware selection. And then the services part covers the various services that can be run on top of the network, such as DNS, web hosting, shared folders, etc. 

We recommend starting with the network part, following the chapters in order, to get a basic network up and running. Once the network is operational, you can then explore the services part to add more functionality to your community network. 

Remember, the goal is to get started quickly and then iterate and improve over time. Don't worry about getting everything perfect from the start; focus on learning and adapting as you go.
