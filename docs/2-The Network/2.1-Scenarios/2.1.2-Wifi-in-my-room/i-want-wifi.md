# I want WiFi in my room

Now I have internet access. Probably someone from the internet service provider company came and set up a router. A good recommendation for starting is just to treat the ISP's router as something it does not exist.

So we need an OpenWrt router to be our "Main Router". You can have some good recommendaions of routers for this in Section X.

The WAN of our OpenWrt router will be connected to the LAN interface of the ISP's router. That would bring "automagically" internet to your router.

Now, if you connect your laptop to the LAN interface of the router, that would automatically bring internet to the laptop.

But we want to go one step forward. We want to provide internet connectivity through WiFi, because this is typically what we always want.

For this...

TODO we can use the christmas AUCOOP workshop.

And you are good to go! You have set up a WiFi network.
