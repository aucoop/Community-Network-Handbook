The approach that this guide follows is the same one would follow when learning something new. For example, assuming you are learning programming, you would start trying to do the "Hello World" exercise. We follow a similar approach, beacuse again, that's what happened when we built [Hahatay Nework](https://hahatay.network)

So this chapter is structured in the following way:

1. I want to have internet access
2. Now that I have internet access, I want a wireless access point so my devices can connect to the internet. This is the "I want wifi in my room chapter".
3. Now I have wifi in my room, but now I want to extend the WiFi signal across, let's say, my whole apartment. So you'll need som sort of WiFi repeater.

At this point things are pretty simple and quite easy to get started. Beyond here things start to get a bit more complex.

1. I want that my wireless signal extends across a big  space.

* It is a big outdoor space where is hard to use wired networks.
* It is a several floor building.

1. My community is geographically scattered across several spaces.

* How can I share the same internet access across all these spaces?
* How can I inter-connect this spaces as if they where in the same space?
