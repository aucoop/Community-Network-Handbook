Until now everything was pretty straightforward, but up until here it really depends on how your space looks like. In this section it is intended to showcase how we solve that in the Hahatay Network case. Probably that will help you or give some inspiration on how to solve the issue for your case.

Let's put the example of Hahatay to showcase how we did approach that.

We are analyzing the site called "Sunukeur" the ISP is at Laura and Mamadou's house. Walls are thick and internet barely goes beyond his house.

So we wanted that the people in Sunukeur could have connectivity in the "main square". The best solution is always throw cable and have something like fast roaming. But throwing cable is not always nor easy, nor cheap nor convenient.

We wanted also have not only one AP, but several of them, so having several dumb AP we already knew it was not a good option.

So we tried with mesh networks. And it works quite ok.

First step is try to guess the "best" position for the routers just by looking at the space. Of course you need to take in account several things like you need a plug to power the APs and you don't want the APs to be super exposed to the weather.

Once you decided the potential best spots according to your needs, then you basically test the power received in every place. We got inspiration from this video. Go and check it out, it will be more understandable than trying to explain it :D

And essentially, that's how we did it for the ~50 APs we have in the whole Hahatay network. Is the most elegant and smart way to do it? Probably not, but we tried, it works, and it still does.
